A fidget spinner game. You play as a fidget spinner set in space (2D plane). You move in the direction of your mouse. You speed up by pressing WAD rhythmically, the closer to on rhythm the better. There's a little screen in the bottom left corner to show timing button presses.

Your goal is to shoot down other fidget spinners. Shots are fired with SpaceBar and come out of your spinner's main circle and follow the line from center of spinner through center of main circle.

If I have time I will add that you start with only 1 of 3 circles, and shooting an enemy circle down gains you a circle, and more circles means higher max speed.
Uses Canvas.
